### Assignment due Tuesday • May 10 • Start of class

#### Part 1: Read the [Final Project description and expectations](https://github.com/ellennickles/programming-for-artists-s22#final-project-1) on the course syllabus

#### Part 2: Research your final project idea
1. **Inspiration**: Research your proposal and collect some notes. How did you become interested in this idea? Quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills? Do you have an drawings, images, videos, sounds, or text to help illustrate what's in your head? Do you have any of your own sketches and/or other people's sketches?
2. **Creative choices**: What ideas you will explore to distinguish your piece and reflect your own point of view?
3. **Context**: What is the story? Who's it for? How will people experience it? Is it interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke something?
4. **Plan**: What steps do you need to take to bring your project to completion? For example, do you need to collect any media assets? Do you need to build the project in a particular order? Do you need to review anything from class? Research and learn something new? What else?
5. **Questions for your classmates**: What are you unsure of, conceptually and technically? On what aspect(s) would you like feedback?

#### Part 3: Plan to present your idea in ~4 minutes next week
- [Add one to two slides to this document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TgJ_E_uyt5Y0OZEJZXuvcCWc2gBySiR6pt9NlTaQPao/edit?usp=sharing) (shared with your CUNY Google account) with your name and some keywords, images, or embed video, etc. to illustrate what’s in your head.
- For full credit be sure to address each of the above research areas in your presentation.
- You should feel free to use your slide(s) to present your idea in any way that makes the most sense for your project.
- *NOTE*: Everyone in the class will share and present from this same presentation file.

## May 10 • Week 13 • Final Project Proposals / Review
