## Example Code Questions
Figuring out how to ask questions in a technical class can be a learning process all its own. Here's a breakdown with examples to get the process started. Try to be as specific as you can. Source: [NYU ITP ICM Code](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2019-Code/wiki/Example-Questions)

- **I have a problem with my code**
    - In line 87 of my sketch (provide link), why does the rectangle not show up in the center of the canvas even though I am calling `rectMode(CENTER)` in line 86?
- **I need a break down!** • What does this error message mean exactly?
    - p5.js says: You wrote `rect(X,X)` and `rect()` was expecting 4 parameters. Try `rect(X,X,X,X)` because `rect()` takes different numbers of parameters depending on what you want to do. Click this link to learn more: [p5js.org/reference/#p5/rect](https://p5js.org/reference/#p5/rect)
- Syntax
    - What does "function" mean?
    - I keep seeing `Unexpected identifier` in error messages. What is it?
    - What is the plus for here? `console.log("Position: " + x);`
- Whys and Whatfors?
    - Why would I make a number a variable that's never going to vary?
    - What's the difference between "mousePressed() and mouseIsPressed"?
- Hows and Can Is
    - How do I create an alternating pattern?
    - How do I highlight something when I mouse over it?
- More examples please.
    - What are some other mouse effects?
- What do the 8 numbers in a quad line of code mean?
    - `quad(138, 131, 186, 120, 169, 263, 230, 276);`
